# NonParametricRegression
Regression of spatial data using kernel functions.  
  
Provided Code...  
   Uses a data set of temperature measurements from 112 weather stations in Oregon held here: http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/s0198247/Data.html
   Uses kernel functions to build various linear regressions predicting the annual mean of the minimum temperature as a function of position.
   Predicts and plots the average annual temperature at each point on a 100x100 grid spanning the weather stations.
   Investigates a regularized kernel method using the lasso. 
   Investigates the effect of differen choices of elastic net constant (alpha)
