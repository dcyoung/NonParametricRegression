# Regression of spatial data using kernel functions.  
 
Provided Code...  
1. Uses a data set of temperature measurements from 112 weather stations in Oregon held here: http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/s0198247/Data.html  
2. Uses kernel functions to build various linear regressions predicting the annual mean of the minimum temperature as a function of position.  
3. Predicts and plots the average annual temperature at each point on a 100x100 grid spanning the weather stations.  
4. Investigates a regularized kernel method using the lasso.  
5. Investigates the effect of differen choices of elastic net constant (alpha)
